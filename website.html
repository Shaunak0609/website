            <p>
                My name is Shaunak and I'm currently a student at University Of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada.
                Currently I'm studying and pursuing a Computer Science major. Overall I've been studying it for 6 years (school included) and the interest is
                definitely there. While my proficiency isn't as good I'm trying to get there and not too afraid of higher level work.

                In my free time, I love all kinds of music, shows and movies and I love to yap about all of them. I also like to read and cook sometimes.

                If what i've said above got you more curious about me, feel free to contact leave a message on.
